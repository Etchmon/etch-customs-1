Dive Deep is a website that asks you to look into your hearts and find some time to care about our ocean. It highlights the biggest threats to our ocean currently, while using advanced CSS techniques and friendly colors to keep you calm while realizing the danger. Thank you for making it to this readme, and checking out this front-end project of mine. I used the 7-1 file architecture, component based design to write reusable, maintainable, and scalable code. The grid is built using custom rows and gutters with a responsive design to make it mobile friendly.
